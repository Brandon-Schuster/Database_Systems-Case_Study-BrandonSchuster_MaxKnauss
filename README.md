Chosen Case Study: MyMobile Telecom

  

To-Do, six files in total (I think).

-   Data Model
    

1.  We can just use MySQL Workbenchâ€™s Built-In one to generate it
    

-   SQL Files
    

2.  Database Setup File
    

-   A file to setup and configure our database
    

-   All entities (a person, place, thing or event about which you are keeping data) with proper keys defined. All attributes, by entity, with data type, length, and constraints defined as appropriate. If your design is relational, your database design (Data Model or ERD) must show all relationships between tables showing captions (1-way is OK), and proper optionality and cardinality. If your design is NOT relational, a drawing will suffice. You should show how the entities in your database are related to each other.
    

3.  Data Population File
    

-   A file with all of our Data to populate everything
    

4.  Query Commands File
    

-   A SQL file with all of our Query commands. Ideally one that can be executed natively. (a proper SQL file)
    

-   Initialization Script
    

5.  Hopefully a UNIX/Win Script(s) to automatically init the database and populate it with our data, or a guide to do so.
    

-  Text files or screenshots of the scripts/commands you used to create and populate your database
    

-   Documentation (this file ig)
    

6.  Documentation File
    

-   Documentation (screenshots) demonstrating the physical implementation of your database that matches your design.
    
-   Screenshots showing the created database
    
-   Documentation showing how you created the database
    
-   Documentation showing how you loaded test data
    
-   The query code and the output of the queries against your database as described in detail requirement # 9 below.
